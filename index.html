            <p>Learning to code not only allows you to give machines instructions, but it also teaches you abstract
                thinking and problem-solving. In fact, problem-solving skills and creativity are key to becoming a
                successful computer programmer. Of course, you'll also need to know some coding languages to apply your
                knowledge</p>

                <h3 class="orenge-color">Web Developers Dream</h3>
                <p>A web developer's primary goal: create functional, user-friendly websites that meet client
                    specifications
                    and the needs of end-users. Web developers' work makes information, services, and products
                    accessible
                    globally. Web developers can work as independent contractors or as traditional full-time employees.
                    You
                    can also work from home as a professional web developer. Many companies hire people like you to
                    create
                    websites and applications for them. If your skill is good, then you can earn a decent amount of
                    money by
                    working full-time or part-time in these companies</p>

                <p>Web Developers usually work in offices or laboratories in comfortable surroundings. They work about
                    40
                    hours a week, but may be required to work some evenings or weekends to meet deadlines or solve
                    specific
                    problems. Web developers are about average in terms of happiness. At CareerExplorer, we conduct an
                    ongoing survey with millions of people and ask them how satisfied they are with their careers. As it
                    turns out, web developers rate their career happiness 3.3 out of 5 stars which puts them in the top
                    43%
                    of careers.</p>
